# price-plus-forecaster
PricePulse is an advanced stock price prediction system designed to forecast future stock prices using historical data and forecasting models. It uses machine learning techniques such as ARIMA to provide users with accurate predictions of stock price trends.

Key Features:

Historical Data Analysis : The app processes historical stock price data, including open, high, low, close, and volume metrics, to identify patterns and trends.
ARIMA Modeling : Implements the ARIMA model, a statistical method widely used for time-series forecasting, to predict short-term and long-term stock price movements.
LSTM Neural Networks : Utilizes LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture complex temporal dependencies in stock price data for more nuanced predictions.
User-Friendly Interface : A clean and intuitive interface allows users to input stock symbols, select forecasting models, and visualize predictions through interactive charts.
Customizable Parameters : Users can adjust model parameters (e.g., training duration, time steps, and confidence intervals) to fine-tune predictions based on their requirements.
Real-Time Insights : Provides insights into potential buy/sell signals by analyzing predicted trends and comparing them with current market conditions.
Exportable Reports : Generates downloadable reports containing forecasts, trend analyses, and performance metrics for further analysis or sharing.

How It Works:

Data Collection : The app fetches historical stock price data from financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
Preprocessing : Cleans and preprocesses the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for modeling.
Model Training : Trains ARIMA and LSTM models on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships in stock price movements.
Prediction : Uses the trained models to forecast future stock prices over user-defined time horizons (e.g., days, weeks, months).
Visualization : Displays predictions alongside historical data using interactive plots powered by libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, or Dash.
Evaluation : Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to ensure reliability.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language : Python
Machine Learning Libraries :
statsmodels (for ARIMA)
TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)

Data Processing : Pandas, NumPy
Visualization : Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn
API Integration : yfinance, Alpha Vantage API
Web Framework: Flask or Streamlit for building a web-based interface.

Use Cases:
Investors : Gain insights into potential future stock price movements to make informed trading decisions.
Analysts : Analyze historical trends and evaluate the effectiveness of different forecasting models.
Educators : Use the app as a teaching tool to demonstrate time-series forecasting and machine learning concepts.
